# Server Mappings

## Why this fork

The goal of this fork is to maintain data for our own specific needs, extra data are stored in the `extra.json` file for each server. We may also add servers or metadata if something is missing. Note that when adding a server we may not follow every guideline of the original repository as we do not need all these pieces of information at the moment. We will most likely only add server IPs and server names, and maybe a server icon.

## Note on the "online-mode" extra data

The "online-mode" is by default set to `false` for every server. It is set to `true` exclusively if we managed to successfully check that the server is indeed in "online-mode".

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this repository, we suggest you do so on the original repository, as we will apply the updates here as well. But if you do not want to follow the guidelines of the original repository as it requires much data, or if you want to edit the extra data, you can contribute here.

To be clear all the rules of the original repository apply here as well, the only thing that differs is that we do not require you to submit all the information, only the server name and at least one IP suffix are required.
